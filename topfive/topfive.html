    <p> I have only visited Seattle once and it during covid. It was october so the leaves were falling and as usual the scky was gloomy.The colors and the landscapes were breathtaking.Since it was mid-pandemic most attractions were closed</p>

<h3>top five pics of lighthouses </h3>
<br>
<p>Lighthouses have always been intriging as they show a symbolism to strength and many overlook the ocean.</p>
<p>Though large bodies of water scare me lighthouses overlook the beauty of nature.</p>
